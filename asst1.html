        <h1 class="h2">Assignment 1: EasyDB Database Driver</h1>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Due Date: Thursday, October 1st, 11:59pm</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Lab TA: Kia Shakiba</strong></p>
      <p>In this assignment, you will develop the driver code for communicating with EasyDB&trade; in Python3.</p>
      
      <h4 id="background">Background</h4>
      <p>A database management system (DBMS) is a piece of software that stores, analyzes, and administers data. Typically, a DBMS is broken into two components: the
         server, which does most of the work; and one or more clients, which send commands to the server and receive responses. For this assignment, we will work with 
		 relational databases (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL).</p>
		 
      <p>Database driver is the client software which provides an interface to database servers. The driver is in charge of sending and receiving data to and from the
	  server, typically through TCP/IP. The data sent across the network are known as <em>packets</em>. In this part of the assignment, you will implement the EasyDB driver
	  in Python3 according to the packet format specification described in the next section.</p>
 
      <h4 id="easydb">EasyDB</h4>
      
      <p>EasyDB is a toy relational database that provides minimalistic features for managing structured data. 
	    In a relational database, data is organized into tables of columns and rows. 
		A column in a database table is a set of data of a primitive type (that is supported by the database). 
		A table is defined with a list of one or more named columns before any data can be inserted. 
		A row is a set of related data that is given meaning through the table it exists in. 
		To insert a row into a table, each value of the row must have the same type as what is defined in the table, 
		in the same order. Also, the number of values in a row must be exactly equal to the number of columns defined in the table. 
		For example, a User table may have the columns: <tt>firstName</tt>, <tt>lastName</tt>, <tt>height</tt> and <tt>age</tt>. 
		A row in a User table may be ("John", "Smith", 5.5, 31), which correctly represents a single user in this table. 
		A table, of course, can have many rows, allowing you to store multiple users in a User table. </p>
      
      <h4 id="schema">Database Schema</h4>
      
      <p>There can also be multiple tables in a relational database, allowing tables to reference others. To specify the database schema (i.e. list of table definitions) in EasyDB, use the following syntax:</p>
      
      <p><var>table-name</var> {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<var>column-name-1</var> : <var>type | table-specifier</var>;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<var>column-name-2</var> : <var>type | table-specifier</var>;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</br>
      }
      </p>
      
      <p>In EasyDB, each column in a table can be one of four types: <tt>integer</tt>, <tt>float</tt>, <tt>string</tt>,
	  or foreign key (i.e. a "pointer" to a record in another table). To specify a foreign key type, use the name of the referenced table. 
	  The names of a table or column must start with a letter, followed by letters (either case), numbers, or underscore. 
	  For example, 888pkr and _private is not allowed, but a5_ is. In addition, "<tt>id</tt>" is a reserved word and cannot be used as a column name.
	  Here is an example of a complete database schema:</p>
      
<pre>
User {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  height: float;
  age: integer;
}

Account {
  user: User;
  type: string;
  balance: float;
}
</pre>      
      
      <p>In the definitions above, we have two tables: User and Account. For every user, we track his/her names, height, and age. For an account, we store the account type and its balance. 
	    Most importantly, an account references the User table. <tt>user</tt> stores the <em>id</em> of a row in the User table. 
		Every row in EasyDB has an automatically generated unique integer id value which allows the row to be unambiguously referenced. 
		In this manner, a user can have zero or more associated accounts.</p>
      
      <p>EasyDB currently disallows cycles in foreign keys. Here are two examples where a cycle occurs:</p>

<pre>
# not allowed in EasyDB
User {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  father: User;
  mother: User;
}
</pre>

<pre>
# also not allowed in EasyDB
User {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  pet: Animal;
}

Animal {
  species: string;
  owner: User;
}
</pre>  
      <p>You can guarantee that there's no cycle if a foreign field only references already defined table (except for the current one). Therefore,
	    to keep this assignment simple, you will disallow forward references, even in cases where cycles would not be formed (e.g., 
		switching the position between User and Account in the first example).</p>
      <h4 id="protocol">Access Protocol</h4>
      
      <p>To access a running EasyDB server, you must know the host name and its port number. Once you are connected, you can make one of five EasyDB queries that are available. 
	    Note that EasyDB assumes that the client is aware of the current schema and does not provide an API for introspection. 
		EasyDB uses binary format as its mean of communication. Therefore, we describe the common structures in the network packets that are used by EasyDB. 
		All structures are defined using C syntax and assumed to be 4-byte aligned, with <tt>int</tt> being 32-bit signed integer, and <tt>long</tt> being 64-bit signed integer. 
		All integers are in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">network byte order</a>.</p>
      
<pre>
enum Command {
    INSERT = 1,
    UPDATE = 2,
    DROP = 3,
    GET = 4,    
    SCAN = 5,
    EXIT = 6,
};
</pre>

<pre>
struct request {
    int command;  /* one of Command */
    int table;    /* table number */
};
</pre>

<pre>
enum Code {
    OK = 1,
    NOT_FOUND = 2,       /* id not found */
    BAD_TABLE = 3,       /* table not found */
    BAD_QUERY = 4,       /* error during scan */ 
    TXN_ABORT = 5,       /* update aborted */
    BAD_VALUE = 6,       /* column value type mismatch */
    BAD_ROW = 7,         /* number of values is incorrect */
    BAD_REQUEST = 8,     /* malformed packet */
    BAD_FOREIGN = 9,     /* foreign key not found */
    SERVER_BUSY = 10,    /* server is busy */
    UNIMPLEMENTED = 11,  /* you can ignore this (you will return this for asst4) */
};
</pre>

<pre>
struct response {
    int code;      /* one of Code */
};
</pre>

      <p>All EasyDB requests begin with <tt>struct request</tt>. The <tt>command</tt> field is one of the six commands listed above, and the <tt>table</tt> field is the table number. 
	    A table's number is the order in which it appears in the schema, starting from 1 (in earlier example, User's table number would be 1, and Account's would be 2). 
		All responses begin with <tt>response</tt>, which contains a code for success (i.e. OK), or error. <tt>BAD_TABLE, BAD_ROW, BAD_VALUE</tt>, and <tt>BAD_REQUEST</tt> are possible 
		for all EasyDB commands except for the Exit command (only <tt>BAD_REQUEST</tt> is possible).</p>
 
<pre>
enum Column {
    NULL = 0,
    INTEGER = 1,
    FLOAT = 2,
    STRING = 3,
    FOREIGN = 4,
};
</pre>

<pre>
struct value {
    int type;     /* one of Column */
    int size;     /* size of buf */
    char buf[];   /* data stored within */
};
</pre>

<pre>
struct row {
    int count;    /* number of elements in values */
    struct value values[];
};
</pre>

      <p>In some packets, we need to send a generic value, or a row of values. In these packets, <tt>struct value</tt> and <tt>struct row</tt> would be used. 
	    <tt>struct value</tt> contains the column type (<tt>type</tt>), the size of the buffer that is needed to store the value (<tt>size</tt>), 
		  and the buffer itself (<tt>buf</tt>). The value of the <tt>size</tt> field differs depending on the column type:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>For <tt>NULL</tt>, <tt>size</tt> is equal to 0.</li>
		<li>For <tt>INTEGER</tt> and <tt>FLOAT</tt>, <tt>size</tt> is equal to 8 (i.e. 8 bytes).</li> 
		<li>For <tt>STRING</tt>, <tt>size</tt> is the size required to store the string in ASCII encoding, but <em>rounded up to the nearest multiples of 4 bytes</em>. 
		  Therefore, the size of the buffer for "bad" would be 4 bytes (3 bytes rounded up to 4), but 8 bytes for "hello" (5 bytes rounded up to 8).
		  If you need to round up the size, then you must pad your buffer with the NUL character (<tt>\x00</tt>). For example, for the string "hello",
		  your buffer should look like <tt>b"hello\x00\x00\x00"</tt>.</li>
      </ul>	 
			 
	  <p>For <tt>struct row</tt>, <tt>count</tt> specifies how many values are stored, and <tt>values</tt> is the array of values specified above.</p>

      <h5>Atomic Update</h5>

<pre>
struct key {
    long id;      /* id of the row */
    long version; /* version of the row */
};
</pre>

      <p>EasyDB supports a primitive version of <em>atomic update</em>. In a concurrent environment, atomic update ensures that changes made to a row will not conflict with changes made by others.
	  In EasyDB, updating a piece of data requires retrieving the initial data followed by modifying it in some ways. For example, to withdraw $100 from an account, 
	  one needs to first know the current balance, and then deduct $100 from it. However, there is a window of time between two EasyDB commands where it is possible that 
	  someone else makes some changes to the same row. For example, the following problem may occur:</p>
      
<pre>
      You            Your Mom     EasyDB
  GET balance ----------------------&gt;
                   GET balance -----&gt;
                       1000    &lt;-----
     1000     &lt;----------------------
                  (deposit $500)
                SET balance 1500 ---&gt;
(withdraw $100)            
SET balance 900 --------------------&gt;           
</pre>

      <p>As you can see above, your final balance is supposed to be $1400. However, due to problematic interleaving of the commands, the deposit made by your mother was lost. 
	  EasyDB protects from this situation by having a version number associated with every row. When you make an update, you pass the version number of the row that you were modifying
	  to the database. If the version number mismatches with what is in the database, a conflict is detected and <tt>TXN_ABORT</tt> is returned, notifying you that your update was aborted, 
	  as seen in the figure below.</p>

<pre>
      You            Your Mom       EasyDB
  GET balance ----------------------&gt;
                   GET balance -----&gt;
                       1000  &lt;------- v1
     1000   &lt;------------------------ v1
                  (deposit $500)
                SET balance 1500 ---&gt; v2
(withdraw $100)            
SET balance 900 --------------------&gt; NO
   TXN_ABORT  &lt;----------------------           
</pre>
      <p>As the programmer, it is likely that you would put an atomic update in a loop so that you can retry if abort occurs.</p>      
      
      <p>We will now describe the format of each EasyDB query.</p>
      
      <h5>Insert Command</h5>
      
      <div class="table-responsive">
      <table class="packet">
        <tr>
          <td>struct request</td><td>struct row</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </div>
      
      <p>The insert command adds a new row to a database table. Its request packet starts with a <tt>request</tt> structure, followed by a <tt>row</tt> structure, which contains one or more values. 
	    For the User table example, the following is an illustration of the packet that is sent to the server:</p>
      
      <div class="table-responsive">
      <table class="packet">
        <tr>
          <td>command: INSERT<br>table: 1</td>
          <td>count: 4</td>
          <td>type: string<br>size: 4<br>buf: "Joe"</td>
          <td>type: string<br>size: 4<br>buf: "Bowen"</td>
          <td>type: float<br>size: 8<br>buf: 5.9</td>
          <td>type: integer<br>size: 8<br>buf: 69</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </div>
 
      <p>Next, the response packet is formatted as shown below:</p>
 
      <div class="table-responsive">
      <table class="packet">
        <tr>
          <td>struct response</td><td>struct key</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </div>

      <p>Note that <tt>struct key</tt> only appears if the response code is <tt>OK</tt>. The insert command can fail if foreign key reference is not found (<tt>BAD_FOREIGN</tt>). 
	    A foreign field is a 64-bit integer that refers to the id of a row in another table. If this field is set to zero, then it does not reference anything
		and it would not be possible to receive <tt>BAD_FOREIGN</tt>.</p>
 
      <h5>Update Command</h5>
 
      <p>The update command is used to update an existing row in a table. It is similar to insert, with the addition that <tt>struct key</tt> of the row needs to be specified. 
	    If you don't care about atomic update, set <tt>version</tt> of <tt>struct key</tt> to 0.</p>
      
      <div class="table-responsive">
      <table class="packet">
        <tr>
          <td>struct request</td><td>struct key</td><td>struct row</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </div>

      <div class="table-responsive">
      <table class="packet">
        <tr>
          <td>struct response</td><td>long version</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </div>

      <p>The response for the update command is similar to insert, except only the new version number is returned. <tt>NOT_FOUND</tt> is returned if the row is not found. 
	    <tt>TXN_ABORT</tt> is returned if atomic update failed. <tt>BAD_FOREIGN</tt> is returned if a foreign field reference does not exist.</p>
 
      <h5>Drop command</h5>
      
      <p>The drop command deletes a row in table. Therefore, it needs to specify the id of the row to be dropped. In EasyDB, the drop command performs <em>cascade delete</em>, 
	    which means that if a row is referenced by rows in other tables, those rows will also be deleted. For example, if a user has three associated accounts, upon deleting the user, 
		all associated accounts will be deleted as well. This design ensures that there will be no dangling pointers in the database.</p>
      
      <div class="table-responsive">
      <table class="packet">
        <tr>
          <td>struct request</td><td>long id</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </div>
      
      <p>The response packet for drop is just <tt>struct response</tt>. <tt>NOT_FOUND</tt> is returned if the row is not found.</p>
      
      <h5>Get Command</h5>
      
      <p>The get command retrieves a row from a table, which requires specifying the id of the row.</p>
      
      <div class="table-responsive">
      <table class="packet">
        <tr>
          <td>struct request</td><td>long id</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </div>
      
      <p>The response packet, on success, will include the row and its associated version number. <tt>NOT_FOUND</tt> is returned if the row is not found.</p>
      
      <div class="table-responsive">
      <table class="packet">
        <tr>
          <td>struct response</td><td>long version</td><td>struct row</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </div>
      
      <h5>Scan Command</h5>

<pre>
enum Operator {
    OP_AL = 1,  /* everything */
    OP_EQ = 2,  /* equal */
    OP_NE = 3,  /* not equal */
    OP_LT = 4,  /* less than */
    OP_GT = 5,  /* greater than */
};
</pre>
      
      <div class="table-responsive">
      <table class="packet">
        <tr>
          <td>struct request</td><td>int column<br>int operator<br></td><td>struct value</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </div>
      
      <p>The scan command compares a column of every row in a table against a value and returns the ids of all rows that matched. The <tt>column</tt> field is the column number to be matched, 
	    based on the order it appears in the table definition, starting with 1. Column 0 corresponds to the internal <tt>id</tt> field. 
		The column type of the <tt>id</tt> field is <tt>FOREIGN</tt>. The <tt>operator</tt> field specifies how to compare against the value stored in <tt>struct value</tt>.</p>
      
      <p>When the operator is <tt>OP_AL</tt>, the server will return valid ids of every row in a table. In this case, the <em>column</em> field of
  	    the packet is ignored (suggestion: set it to 0).
	    The <em>type</em> field of <em>struct value</em> should be <tt>NULL</tt>, and the <em>size</em> should be set to zero.</p>
      
      <div class="table-responsive">
      <table class="packet">
        <tr>
          <td>struct response</td><td>int count<br>long ids[]<br></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </div>

      <p>On success, the response will contain zero or more ids (zero is possible if there were no matches). <tt>BAD_QUERY</tt> is returned if one of the following errors occurred: 
	    1) column type and value type mismatched, or 2) operator for the given type is not supported. In EasyDB, id and foreign field only support <tt>OP_EQ</tt> and <tt>OP_NE</tt>. 
		For <tt>string</tt>, <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/strcmp">lexicographical comparison</a> is performed (e.g., "A" is less than "B" and "5" is less than "-2").</p>
      
      <h5>Exit Command</h5>
      
      <div class="table-responsive">
      <table class="packet">
        <tr>
          <td>struct request</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </div>
      
      <p>The exit command shuts down the connection gracefully. There is no server response for this command. The server will disconnect once it receives this command. 
	    You may set any value for the <tt>table</tt> field, but 1 is preferred.</p>

	  <h4 id="binary">Binary Format</h4>
	  <p>Since you will be working extensively on converting between Python basic types and binary data (the format of network packets), 
	  this section serves as a primer for the Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html"><tt>struct</tt> library</a>.
	  You should reference the documentation for any detail not described here.</p>
	  
	  <p>In Python, binary data is represented by the <tt>bytearray</tt> type, which, in C++, is similar to a char array (note that in C++,
	    char array can be used either as a string or as a buffer. We will assume the latter for this assignment). A bytearray is similar
		to a Python string. However, a string may contain unicode characters (such as the plus-minus sign ±), whereas a bytearray contains 
		only uninterpreted bytes. In Python,
		you can create a bytearray literal by prefixing a string with the character <tt>b</tt>:</p>
		
<pre>
&gt;&gt; packet = b'abc123'
&gt;&gt; type(packet)
&lt;class 'bytes'&gt;
</pre>		
		<p>
		Note that the content of a bytearray is identical to a string <em>if</em> the string contains only ASCII characters. This is because
		ASCII characters can fit inside a byte, whereas unicode characters require at least two bytes. When the byte cannot be represented
		as an ASCII character, then it will show up as <tt>\xNN</tt> where NN is the hex value of the byte, for example, <tt>b'\x00\x0f'</tt>
		is a bytearray with two bytes, the first byte has the value 0, and the second byte has the value 15 (<tt>f</tt> in hex is 15 in decimal).
		</p>
		
		<p>To create a packet, you must convert a Python basic type into binary data. You will need to use the <tt>struct.pack</tt> 
		function to do so (alternatively, you can use
		<tt>pack_into</tt> and the <tt>pack</tt> method of the class <tt>Struct</tt>, which we will not discuss here). Before you pack,
		you need to know four pieces of information about the binary data format that you wish to convert to:</p>
		
		<ol>
		  <li><em>Data type</em>: integer, float, or byte(s).</li>
		  <li><em>Signedness</em>: signed (negative values allowed) or unsigned.</li>
		  <li><em>Size</em>: determines the maximum range of values the binary type can handle.</li>
		  <li><em>Endianness</em>: little-endian or big-endian.</li>
		</ol>
      
		<p>You should refer to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#format-strings">Format Strings</a> section of
		the <tt>struct</tt> library documentation for a full list of supported binary format.</p>
		
		<p>For example, if we want to create a packet that contains a single 4-byte big-endian signed integer, we would use the
		<tt>"&gt;i"</tt> format string to create the packet, like this:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt; struct.pack("&gt;i", 42)
b'\x00\x00\x00*'
</pre>		

		<p>In the output, we see a weird asterisks at the end. Do not worry, that is because the ASCII value of the asterisks character is the decimal 
		value 42.</p>
		<p>You can also pack multiple values with a single <tt>struct.pack</tt> call. For example, if we want to pack a 4-byte signed integer,
		followed by an 8-byte floating point number, we can do this:</p>
		
<pre>
&gt;&gt; packet = struct.pack("&gt;id", 1, 1.0)
&gt;&gt; packet
b'\x00\x00\x00\x01?\xf0\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'
</pre>		
	  <p>Here, the first 4 bytes (<tt>b'\x00\x00\x00\x01'</tt>) belongs to the integer 1, and the rest of the bytearray belongs to the floating
	    point number 1.0.</p>
		
      <p>To convert binary data back to Python basic types, use <tt>struct.unpack</tt> with the same format string. For example, to get 
	  back the two values that we packed, we can do this:</p>
	  
<pre>
&gt;&gt; struct.unpack("&gt;id", packet)
(1, 1.0)
</pre>		  
	  <p>Note that <tt>struct.unpack</tt> will always return a tuple, even if you only unpacked one value.</p>

	  <p>Lastly, you are likely going to need to make multiple calls to <tt>struct.pack</tt> to create various pieces of the packet, such
	  as <tt>struct request</tt> and <tt>struct value</tt>. At the end, you must send a single bytearray over the network. Therefore, you
	  will need to concatenate the bytearrays. Please refer the the lectures on how to concatenate strings; the same methods and operators
	  work for bytearrays as well.</p>
	  
      <h4 id="setup">Setup</h4>

</pre>

      <p>The starter code include the following files. Note that we will only test the files that are part of the easydb package.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>main.py</em>: contains the <tt>main</tt> function which allows you to run in interactive mode for testing purposes.</li>

		  You will implement the Database class to send and receive packets to and from the server.</li>
		<li><em>easydb/packet.py</em>: has constants for the EasyDB commands, codes, and operator. You can change this to add packet processing code.</li>  
        <li><em>easydb/exception.py</em>: contains all the exception classes used by the database implementation. Do not change.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="specification">Solution Requirements</h4>
      <p>This assignment has a couple of milestones, each of which can work independently and thus are worth partial marks. 
	    You and your partner should take on one of each part of the assignment.
        In order to communicate with the database server, you need to write a client library in Python3 that will send requests to an EasyDB server 
		as well as parsing responses received from the server. The interface is described here.</p>
      
      <h5>Database Schema</h5>
      <p>As said earlier, the server assumes the client knows the schema, so the user of your library must supply the schema to the client to instantiate it. 
	    Here is an example of how your EasyDB library will be initialized.</p>
<pre>
import easydb

tb = (
    ("User", (                  # table_name
        ("firstName", str),     # (column_name, type)
        ("lastName", str),
        ("height", float),
        ("age", int),
    )),
    
    ("Account", (
        ("user", "User"),       # (column_name, table_reference)
        ("type", str),
        ("balance", float),
    ))
)

db = easydb.Database(tb)
</pre>
      <p>The above code creates a Database object. If there is an issue with the provided schema, then it should throw the following errors:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><tt>TypeError</tt>: thrown when either table name or column name is not a string, or <em>tb</em> is not iterable.</li>
        <li><tt>ValueError</tt>: thrown when type is not one of str, float, int, a string referencing another table name, duplicate table or column names, or illegal table or column names.</li>
		<li><tt>IndexError</tt>: thrown when <em>tb</em> is malformed (hint: let Python do its thing and access elements of sequence without error checking).</li>
        <li><tt>IntegrityError</tt>: thrown when foreign keys causes a cycle or if foreign field references a nonexistent table.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Next, we connect to the server via the <tt>connect</tt> member function.</p>
<pre>
success = db.connect("127.0.0.1", 8080)
</pre>
      <p><tt>connect</tt> takes two arguments, the host name and the port number. You should use Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/socket.html">socket</a> 
	    library to implement this function. The function should throw whatever error <tt>socket.connect</tt> throws (Hint: don't error check on any of <tt>socket</tt>'s methods).
        The server will return a <tt>struct response</tt> immediately after connecting. You are required to disconnect immediately if the error code is <tt>SERVER_BUSY</tt> and the
		function should return <tt>False</tt> after proper clean up. If there is no error (i.e. error code is <tt>OK</tt>), the function should return <tt>True</tt>.
	  <p>When reading from sockets, you may assume the maximum packet size will not exceed 4096 bytes.</p>	
      <p>Now, implement the <tt>close</tt> method to disconnect from the server and clean up the socket. You should send the Exit command before closing the connection to inform the server that you are shutting down the connection gracefully.</p>
<pre>
db.close()
</pre> 
      
      <p>The main part of this assignment is implementing all of EasyDB commands. You will be using Python's <a href="#binary">
	    <tt>struct</tt> library</a> to help construct the individual pieces of an EasyDB packet and also to parse responses from the server. 
	    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html"><tt>io.BytesIO</tt></a> is a great option for packing multiple <tt>bytearray</tt>
		together to form a single packet. When the server responds in error, you should throw objects of the corresponding error classes.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><tt>ObjectDoesNotExist</tt>: corresponds to the error code <tt>NOT_FOUND</tt>.</li>
        <li><tt>InvalidReference</tt>: corresponds to the error code <tt>BAD_FOREIGN</tt>.</li>
        <li><tt>TransactionAbort</tt>: corresponds to the error code <tt>TXN_ABORT</tt>.</li>
        <li><tt>PacketError</tt>: corresponds to the error code <tt>BAD_TABLE</tt>, <tt>BAD_VALUE</tt>,
          <tt>BAD_ROW</tt>, and <tt>BAD_REQUEST</tt>. They all fall under the same category because the database client is supposed to have caught these mistakes before sending off the request.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Now, here is the specification for each command:</p>
      
      <h5>Insert Command</h5>
      <pre>insert(table_name, values)</pre>
      <p><em>table_name</em> is the name of the table, and <em>values</em> should be a sequence (e.g., list, tuple) of <em>N</em> elements 
	    where <em>N</em> is the number of columns in the table. You should throw a <tt>PacketError</tt> if any of the arguments have problems, 
		such as the table name does not exist, the number of elements in <tt>values</tt> is incorrect, or one of the columns have an invalid type 
		(i.e., must be one of the native types that EasyDB supports). If the response is <tt>OK</tt>, return a tuple of <em>pk</em>, <em>version</em>, where <em>pk</em> is the id only the newly created object. For example:</p>
      
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; pk, version = db.insert("User", ["Jane", "Doe", 5.2, 22])
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(pk, version)
1 1
</pre>

	  <p>You will need to encode strings into bytes objects before they can be sent across network. Use the <tt>encode</tt> string method to do this. You may assume
	    EasyDB only supports ASCII strings.</p>
      
      <h5>Update Command</h5>
      <pre>update(table_name, pk, values, version=0)</pre>
      <p>Same as insert, with two more arguments, <em>pk</em> and <em>version</em>. <em>pk</em> is the id of the row to update, and <em>version</em> is optional, and if specified, 
		will enable atomic update. If the response is <tt>OK</tt>, returns the new <em>version</em>, regardless of whether atomic update was enabled or not.
		This is an example where atomic update is not activated:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; version = db.update("User", 1, ["Jane", "Doe", 5.1, 31])
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(version)
2
</pre>
      <p>If either <tt>pk</tt> or <tt>version</tt> is not an integer, you should raise <tt>PacketError</tt>. </p>
      <h5>Drop Command</h5>
      <pre>drop(table_name, pk)</pre>
      <p><em>table_name</em> is the name of the table, and <em>pk</em> is the id of the row to be deleted. This method does not return a value, 
	    but <tt>ObjectDoesNotExist</tt> is raised if the id does not exist in the specified table. For example:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; db.drop("User", 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
easydb.exception.ObjectDoesNotExist: User object 2 is not found
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
      
	  <p>You should raise <tt>PacketError</tt> if <tt>pk</tt> is not an integer.</p>
      <h5>Get Command</h5>
      <pre>get(table_name, pk)</pre>
      <p><em>table_name</em> is the name of the table, and <em>pk</em> is the id of the row to be retrieved.  
	    <tt>ObjectDoesNotExist</tt> is raised if the object cannot be found. If the response is <tt>OK</tt>, return a list of the values and the version. 
		For example:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; values, version = db.get("User", 1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(values)
['Jane', 'Doe', 5.1, 31]
</pre>
      
	  <p>For string, remember to decode it from the bytes object you receive from network. Raise <tt>PacketError</tt> if <tt>pk</tt> is not an integer.</p> 
	  
      <h5>Scan Command</h5>
      <pre>scan(table_name, op, column_name=None, value=None)</pre>
      <p><em>table_name</em> is the name of the table, <em>op</em> is the operator, <em>column_name</em> is the name of the column and also the left operand,
	    and <em>value</em> is a constant value and also the right operand. 
	    <tt>PacketError</tt> should be thrown if the column name does not exist, operator is not supported, the right operand is the wrong data type, 
		or table name does not exist. If the response is <tt>OK</tt>, return a list of all matching ids (may be empty). For example:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from easydb import operator
&gt;&gt;&gt; results = db.scan("Account", operator.GT, "balance", 10000.0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(results)
[1, 3, 7]
</pre>

	  <p>Note: Do not forget about the internal <tt>id</tt> field. Also, when the operator is <tt>OP_AL</tt>, you should ignore the column name.</p>
      <h4 id="testing">Testing Your Code</h4>
      <p>To test your database client, you will need to run the server. 
		Remember to go through <a href="labs.html#testing">Tester Setup</a> first, otherwise you will not find the executable for the server, which
		is placed in the folder <tt>/cad2/ece326f/tester/bin</tt>.
	    You can start the server by running <tt>easydb -g PORT</tt> on one terminal while running the client on a different terminal, 
	    where the <tt>-g</tt> option will print everything the database is doing, and <tt>PORT</tt> is the port number. 
		You should choose a unique port number so that other people also working on your machine would not accidentally connect to your database. 
		By default, the server will load <tt>default.txt</tt> for the database schema, but you should probably test with different schema to make sure your code is truly working. 
		Type <tt>easydb</tt> to see the usage on how to specify a different schema file.</p>
      
      <p>To test the database client, you can either write a custom script that uses your EasyDB database driver, or you can run in interactive mode using the <tt>main.py run</tt> command. 
	    It will start interactive mode after automatically connecting to the database, and storing the database object as <tt>db</tt>. For example:</p>
      
<pre>
student:~/asst1$ ./main.py run
Python 3.5.2 (default, Oct  8 2019, 13:06:37) 
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
(InteractiveConsole)
&gt;&gt;&gt; db
&lt;EasyDB Database object&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; db.get("User", 1)
['Greg', 'Russell', 6.1, 27]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>      
    
	<p>Note that you will need to change the <tt>tb</tt> variable in <tt>main.py</tt> if you load the database server with a different schema!</p>
	
      <h4 id="submission">Code Submission</h4>
      <p>To submit your code with the current commit, use the <tt>Asst1-end</tt> tag. Remember to push the new tag to the remote repository.</p>
 
<pre>
git tag Asst1-end    // Creates tag for current submission for Assignment 1
git push --tags
</pre>
      
      <h4 id="glossary">Glossary of Terms</h4>
      <p>Here, you can find the definition of commonly seen terms that are used in the assignment. More will be added as people ask questions about the assignment.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><b>table</b>: a group of data with the same user-defined format, similar to a class in object-oriented programming.</li>
        <li><b>row</b>: a record in a database table, similar to an instance of a class.</li>
        <li><b>column</b>: a "field" in a database row, with an associated name.</li>
		<li><b>broken pipe</b>: this error happens when the other side of the connection ended without calling <tt>close</tt>(). For example,
		  if you kill the server process (e.g. <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd>), you will get a broken pipe on the client side. Similarly, if you forgot
		  to call <tt>close</tt>() in your client code before ending your program, the server will get a broken pipe error.</li>
      </ul>
