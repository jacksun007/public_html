      <h4 id="evaluation">Grading Scheme</h4>
      <p>There will be 4 major assignments throughout the term, one midterm exam and one final exam. Also, during each tutorial session, you will be asked to complete a simple quiz. The breakdown of the final mark is shown here:</p>
      
      <dl class="row">  
        <dt class="offset-1 col-5 col-sm-3">Assignment 1</dt><dd class="col">7%</dd>

        <dt class="offset-1 col-5 col-sm-3">Quizzes</dt><dd class="col">5% Bonus*</dd>
      </dl><!--row-->
      
      <p>
      The midterm and the final exam will be Type B <em>closed book</em> exams. The examiner will provide the cheat sheet for the exams, but students may not bring their own special aids or cheat sheet.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      *There will be 12 quizzes, but you only need to complete 10 out of the 12 to receive full marks. These quizzes are intended as exercises and thus will only be checked for completion and not for correctness by the TAs. The TAs will provide the answer to each quiz at the end of the tutorial. The bonus marks will go towards your total assignment marks only. For example, if you did not submit any assignment but did all the quizzes, you will receive 5% out of 30%. If you received 27% on your assignments, you will receive 30% out of 30% (bonus mark cannot top you up over 30%).
      </p>
      
      <p>There will strictly be no extensions for assignments. It is your responsibility to give yourself enough time to properly submit your assignment.</p>
      
      <p>For any remarking requests, contact the course instructor directly. You may not submit a remarking request later than two weeks after the assignment or exam is returned.</p>
      
      <h5>Policy on Cheating</h5>
      <p>Plagiarism and cheating <strong>WILL NOT</strong> be tolerated under any circumstances. Cheating includes, but is not limited to, generating expected output in an attempt to fool the automated marking script, or using unauthorized aids in assignments and exams. It is also an offense to allow a copy of your work to be submitted by another person for credit, whether with or without your knowledge. As such, it is your responsibility to protect your work from being copied by others.</p>

      <p>All assignments submitted for credit in this course will be compared pairwise to attempt to identify cases of collusion, copying, and similar offenses. The comparison is performed by a sophisticated program that is capable of detecting similar programs even if considerable effort has been taken to conceal their similarity.</p>

      <p>Any work submitted for credit that is not the work of the person(s) submitting it will be treated as an offense under the Code of Academic Discipline of the University. The Code of Academic Discipline will be rigidly enforced in this course. Penalties can range from grade penalties in the course to suspension from the university. The Dean, as advised by the instructors and the Departmental Chair, determines the penalty for each case.</p>

      <p>For more details, please refer to the <a href="https://www.academicintegrity.utoronto.ca/">Academic Integrity web site</a> at the University.</p>
