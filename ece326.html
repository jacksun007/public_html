	  <p>The links to the assignments and exams will be added as they are released. The quizzes, midterms and the final exam will be conducted <em>online</em> this year. More information will be available closer to start of term. 
	     The date and time of the exams are currently <em>tentative</em>. Let me know as soon as possible if there are any conflicts with your other courses.</p>

      <h4 id="evaluation">Grading Scheme</h4>
      <p>There will be four major assignments throughout the term, three quizzes, two midterm exams and one final exam. The breakdown of the final mark is shown here:</p>
      
      <dl class="row">  
        <dt class="offset-1 col-5 col-sm-3">Assignment 1,2,4</dt><dd class="col">10% x 3</dd>

      </dl><!--row-->

      <p>The assignments will be done in groups of two this semaster. There will be strictly no extensions for assignments. It is your responsibility to give yourself enough time to properly submit your assignment.</p>
      
      <p>For any remarking requests, contact the course instructor directly. You may not submit a remarking request later than two weeks after the assignment or exam is returned.</p>
      
      <h5>Policy on Cheating</h5>
      <p>Plagiarism and cheating <strong>WILL NOT</strong> be tolerated under any circumstances. Cheating includes, but is not limited to, generating expected output in an attempt to fool the automated marking script, or using unauthorized aids in assignments and exams. It is also an offense to allow a copy of your work to be submitted by another person for credit, whether with or without your knowledge. As such, it is your responsibility to protect your work from being copied by others.</p>

      <p>All assignments submitted for credit in this course will be compared pairwise to attempt to identify cases of collusion, copying, and similar offenses. The comparison is performed by a sophisticated program that is capable of detecting similar programs even if considerable effort has been taken to conceal their similarity.</p>

      <p>Any work submitted for credit that is not the work of the person(s) submitting it will be treated as an offense under the Code of Academic Discipline of the University. The Code of Academic Discipline will be rigidly enforced in this course. Penalties can range from grade penalties in the course to suspension from the university. The Dean, as advised by the instructors and the Departmental Chair, determines the penalty for each case.</p>

      <p>For more details, please refer to the <a href="https://www.academicintegrity.utoronto.ca/">Academic Integrity web site</a> at the University.</p>
