        <h1 class="h2">Assignment 2: Object-Relational Mapping</h1>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Due Date: Thursday, October 22nd, 11:59pm</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Lab TA: Martiya Zare Jahromi</strong></p>
      <p>In this assignment, you will develop an object relational mapping (ORM) framework for EasyDB&trade; in Python.</p>
      
      <h4 id="background">Background</h4>
      
      <p>Object-relational mapping is a technique for converting database records to and from in-memory objects. 
	  Therefore, instead of writing code that extract values from a database query such as this:</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-9">
<pre>
# returns a Record object
rec = db.execute("GET 2 FROM User")
if rec.valid():
    name = rec["firstName"]
</pre>      

      <p>into this:</p>

<pre>
from schema import User
import orm

# returns a User object
try:
    user = User.get(db, pk=2)
    name = user.firstName
except orm.ObjectDoesNotExist:
    pass
</pre>
</div>
<div class="col-md-3">
<img src="img/webstack.svg" alt="Web Stack" height="300px" style="margin-bottom:1rem;">
</div>
</div>
	  <p>In other words, with ORM, you can treat database tables as classes and database rows as objects, allowing the end user to 
	    write object-oriented code. More importantly, ORM layer abstracts away the underlying database implementation, 
		allowing the end users possible freedom to switch from one database solution to another (e.g. from EasyDB to MySQL)
		without having to rewrite their entire application to use the new database solution.</p>
      
      <p>Another advantage is that an ORM framework can help with converting in-memory types to and from storage types seamlessly. 
	  For example, some relational databases, such as EasyDB, do not natively support an IP Address type. 
	  Therefore, to store an IP address in these databases, it must first be converted to a string (e.g. "127.0.0.1"). 
	  Then, more code is required to read it back from the database and convert it back to an IP Address object. 
	  These tedious tasks can be automated with ORM.</p>
      
      <p>Your task in this assignment is to develop an ORM framework which is used by other programmers to build their web applications. 
	  This ORM layer allows web developers to specify the layout of their database directly in Python, 
	  and be able to work with Python objects in their program, rather than having to use the low level database client. 
	  Your ORM layer will also support complex data types not generally available natively in database solutions, 
	  which will improve the robustness of the web applications built on top of the ORM layer.</p>
      
      <h4 id="setup">Setup</h4> 
<pre>
cd ~/ece326
tar -xf /cad2/ece326f/src/orm.tar
git status # should say that "asst2/" directory is untracked
git add asst2
git commit -m "Initial code for Assignment 2"
git tag Asst2-start
git push
git push --tags
cd asst2
make # this will create a symbolic link to your EasyDB driver package
</pre>

      <p>The starter code include the following files. Note that we will only test the files that are part of the orm package.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>schema.py</em>: includes user-defined tables. You are encouraged to change this file to help you with testing your ORM layer.</li>
        <li><em>main.py</em>: contains the <tt>main</tt> function which allows you to either run in interactive mode for testing purposes, or export the currently loaded schema.</li>
        <li><em>Makefile</em>: this will create a symbolic link to your assignment 1 EasyDB driver package.</li>
		<li><em>orm/__init__.py</em>: package-level export of classes and functions. Do not change.</li>
		<li><em>orm/orm.py</em>: you will change this file to implement the <tt>setup</tt> and <tt>export</tt> functions.</li>
        <li><em>orm/table.py</em>: definition for a database table. You will implement the <tt>Table</tt> class and its associated metaclass (you do not have to use a metaclass if you prefer other implementation).</li>
        <li><em>orm/fields.py</em>: You will change this file to implement all the fields supported by the ORM layer, including custom fields not natively supported by the underlying database.</li>
        <li><em>orm/.gitignore</em>: ignores the easydb symbolic link.</li>
	  </ul>

      <h4 id="specification">Solution Requirements</h4>
      <p>This assignment has a couple of milestones, each of which can work independently and thus are worth partial marks. 
	  You and your partner should take on one of each part of the assignment. Please note that this assignment depends on full completion
	  of assignment 1. So if you did not get 100% in assignment 1, please go back and make sure you finish it, otherwise assignment 2
	  will not work properly. You may also need to fix hidden bugs in assignment 1 if the assignment 1 tester failed to uncover them (let
	  the instructor know about the bug in this case, so that a new check can be added to the tester for next year).</p>
	  
	  <p>Keep in mind that once you have completed your assignment 1 code, it should not need to be changed for assignment 2. All the 
	    new code you write for assignment 2 should interact with the interface provided by assignment 1.</p>

      <h4 id="orm_schema">Database Model</h4>
      <p>In an object-relational mapping software, the programmer would write their database schema in a database-neutral language (i.e., in a way that the underlying database could be swapped out without affecting the program). For our ORM, the programmer will write the schema in Python (inspired by <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>). Let's first look at an example schema:</p>
      
<pre>
# schema.py

import orm

class User(orm.Table):
    firstName = orm.String()
    lastName = orm.String()
    height = orm.Float(blank=True)
    age = orm.Integer(blank=True)
    
    def __repr__(self):
      return "&lt;User: %s %s&gt;"%(self.firstName, self.lastName)
    
class Account(orm.Table):
    user = orm.Foreign(User)
    type = orm.String(choices=["Savings", "Chequing",], default="Chequing")
    balance = orm.Float()
</pre> 
     
      <p>All database tables defined in the Python schema file will need to inherit <tt>orm.Table</tt>. Column names must start with a letter, followed by letters of either case, 
	  or numbers, but underscore is <em>not</em> allowed (the ORM layer will use it for a special purpose). Also, the word <em>pk</em>, <em>version</em>,
	  <em>save</em> and <em>delete</em> are reserved by the ORM layer (see next section for what each of these attributes do) and cannot be used as
	  column names (they are fine as table names). Lastly, you may not re-define a table (e.g. define User class, and define User class again later), 
	  even though it is legal in Python to do so. This rule applies to tables defined across multiple schema (e.g. define a User class in both <em>a.py</em> 
	  and <em>b.py</em>, and importing them into <em>main.py</em>).
	  Raise <tt>AttributeError</tt> (not <tt>ValueError</tt>) if any of the three rules 
	  is violated. Do not change the original EasyDB naming rules.</p>
	  
	  <p>For each column in the table, it is represented by an instance of one of the following <tt>Field</tt> subclasses: <tt>String</tt>, 
		<tt>Integer</tt>, <tt>Float</tt>, and <tt>Foreign</tt>. Each of these classes corresponds to a primitive type that EasyDB supports. 
		For the first three classes, there are no positional parameters. For <tt>Foreign</tt>, it takes one positional parameter: 
		the class of the referenced table. Notice that it is not possibe to reference a class that has yet to be defined. 
		For later part of this assignment, you will be adding new field types and building them on top of the primitive types.</p>
      
      <p>Every field types, except for Foreign, support the following options:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><b>blank</b>: this field is allowed to be left unspecified in the constructor of database table objects. When this option is set 
		to <tt>False</tt>, 
		  <tt>AttributeError</tt> will be raised when attempting to create a new object with the field is not specified. 
		  If blank is <tt>True</tt>, default value will be used (see next point on default option) when the field is not specified in the constructor.
        </li>
        <li><b>default</b>: the default value for this field if it is unspecified in the constructor. When the default option is specified,
		    <tt>blank</tt> will forced to <tt>True</tt> in order for the default value to be used.
		  If the default value is a function (i.e. a callable), you should 
		  support calling the function to retrieve the default value. See <a href="#custom_types">Custom Type</a> for an example. Note that every
		  field type should have a base default value if it is not specified (e.g. 0 for int, "" for string).</li>
        <li><b>choices</b>: a list of allowed values for this field. <tt>ValueError</tt> will be raised if the field has value not in <tt>choices</tt> when insert or update is attempted.
		  <tt>ValueError</tt> will also be raised if <tt>choices</tt> is not iterable.
		</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Foreign, on the other hand, only supports <i>blank</i>. If <em>blank</em> is true, the field can reference nothing (i.e. set to <tt>None</tt>).</p>
      
      <p>The Field subclasses must raise <tt>TypeError</tt> during initialization (i.e., while the class is being created) if 
		either one or more of the choices or default value is the wrong type, or if the specified default value is not in the list
		of choices (only check this when <em>blank</em> is <tt>True</tt>). For example:</p>

<pre>      
class User(orm.Table):
    firstName = orm.String()
    lastName = orm.String(default=123)
    height = orm.Float(choices=["wrong", "type"])    
</pre>

      <p>Lastly, you should ensure that the order of the fields are preserved. Otherwise they may
      end up scrambled and you will wonder why the insert command complains
      about mismatching types. Hint: your metaclass should overload the <tt>__prepare__</tt> method and return an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/collections.html">OrderedDict</a>.</p>
      
      <p>Our ORM provides two interfaces to initialize the underlying database client.</p>

<h5>Setup</h5>
<pre>
orm.setup(database_name, module)
</pre>
      <p><em>setup</em> will return a database object that is initialized, but not yet connected. <em>database_name</em> 
	  is the name of the underlying database implementation. Currently, we only support one argument: "easydb". <em>module</em> is the module that 
	  contains the schema (e.g. schema.py). </p>
<pre>
import schema
db = orm.setup("easydb", schema)  # this should create easydb.Database
db.connect("127.0.0.1", 8080)
</pre>

	<p>Note that <tt>setup</tt> will only use tables defined at the global scope of <tt>module</tt>. For example, if User and Account are defined in
	<em>a.py</em>, and Book and Author are defined in <em>b.py</em>, then calling <tt>setup</tt> with module <em>a</em> will return a Database object
	with only User and Account defined. Same principle applies to the <tt>export</tt> function described next.</p>

<h5>Export</h5>
<pre>
orm.export(database_name, module)
</pre>
      <p><em>export</em> will return a string which can be read by the underlying database to create the corresponding database tables, 
	  each with the specified columns, similar to the example shown in the <a href="asst1.html#schema">Database Schema</a> section of assignment 1. 
	  This feature is helpful so that you do not have to write the database schema manually in EasyDB format on top of writing the Python ORM format. For example: the following Python schema:</p>
      
<pre>
class Course(orm.Table):
    instructor = orm.Foreign(Person)
    name = orm.String()
    difficulty = orm.Float(default=5.0)
    numEnrolled = orm.Integer(blank=True)   # cannot use underscore (num_enrolled not allowed)
</pre>
      <p>is exported as a string shown here:</p>
<pre>
Course {
    instructor : Person;
    name : string;
    difficulty : float;
    numEnrolled : integer;
}
</pre>      
      <p>Note that if there are multiple tables in the schema, then there will be multiple tables in the exported format. Also, all field options are ignored because they are only enforced by the ORM layer. The user of the export function will likely save the output to a file to be used to initiate the database server.</p>
      <h4 id="methods">Table Methods</h4>
      
      <p>For each table in the schema, the following class methods are defined. For each of these methods, Table should be replaced by the actual Table in the schema (e.g., User, Account).</p>
      
      <h5>Object Interface</h5>
<pre>
object = Table(db, ...)
</pre>      
      <p>Create a new object (row) of type Table. The constructor accepts keyword arguments which are the column names of the table, and one positional argument: the database object. Default values are used for unspecified columns. If blank is not true and no default is specified, then the field must be initialized in the constructor. For example:</p>
<pre>
# joe.height is 0.0
joe = User(db, firstName="Joe", lastName="Harris", age=32)
</pre>

      <p>Each instance has the following attributes on top of the column fields:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>save</b>: Saves the object to the database. For new objects in EasyDB, this will call <tt>insert</tt>. For existing objects, this will call <tt>update</tt>. For fields where <tt>blank</tt> is true, the field is set to the default type value. <tt>save</tt> takes an optional parameter, <tt>atomic</tt>, which is by default true. If set to false, disables atomic update for that save.</li>
        <li><b>delete</b>: Deletes the object. In EasyDB, this will call the <tt>drop</tt> command.</li>
        <li><b>pk</b>: the id of the object (i.e. primary key). This field is <tt>None</tt> before it is in the database.</li>
        <li><b>version</b>: the version of the object. This field is <tt>None</tt> before it is in the database.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here is an example of an object's usage, continuing from the above example:</p>
<pre>
joe.pk is None    # True
joe.height == 0.  # True
joe.lastName = "Smith"
joe.save()
joe.pk            # 2 (the id of the object)
joe.version       # 1 (the version of the object)
joe.age = 33
joe.save(atomic=False)    # disable atomic update for this call to easydb.update
joe.version               # 2 (new version of the object)
joe.age = 34
joe.save()                # this will call easydb.update, which may raise TransactionAbort
joe.delete()              # deletes the row from the database
joe.pk is None            # True
joe.save()                #
joe.pk                    # 4 (the new id of the object)
</pre>
      <p>Note that when setting field value, if the type does not match, <tt>TypeError</tt> should be thrown. The only exception is when assigning an integer to a float field. In this case, you should accept implicit type conversion. For example:</p>
<pre>
joe.age = "55"    # NO - assigning string to integer field
joe.height = 3    # OK - assigning integer to float field
joe.age = 3.5     # NO - assigning float to integer field
</pre>      
      <p>All foreign key references are converted automatically to their objects. Hint: you can implement this lazily 
	  (only retrieve from database when field is accessed), or eagerly (retrieve foreign keys during the ORM <em>get</em> operation).</p>
      
<pre>
account = Account.get(db, pk=2)
account.user  # &lt;User: Joe Smith&gt;
</pre>

      <p>When calling <tt>save</tt>(), if referenced object is already in the database (i.e. <tt>pk</tt> field is set and not <tt>None</tt>), 
	  then you should only save the current object. However, if it is not in the database when you save another object, 
	  the referenced object will be saved first before the object is saved. For example:</p>
      
<pre>
greg = User(db, firstName="Greg", lastName="Russell", age=27)
account = Account(db, user=greg, type="Chequing", balance=100.0)
account.save()  # will save 'greg' first before saving 'account'
saving = Account(db, user=greg, type="Saving", balance=200.0)
saving.save()   # will not save 'greg' at all since it already exists in database
</pre>

      <p>The above scenario can be recursive for multiple levels of references. Note that for a foreign field, you must set it with an object of the expected type, or <tt>None</tt> if the field is allowed to be blank.</p>
      
<pre>
account.user = greg             # OK
account.user = 3                # NO - cannot use object id
account.user = User.get(db, 3)  # OK
account.user = None             # NO - blank is not specified for this field
account.user = account2         # NO - incorrect object type (only instance of User accepted)
</pre>      

      <p>You are suggested to use descriptors to implement fields. However, other implementations are possible, such as using __getattr__, __getattribute__, or property. You may not defer type checking until save(), so using an ordinary data field is not a viable option.</p>
      
<h5>Get Method</h5>  
<pre>
object = Table.get(db, pk)
</pre>
      <p>Returns an existing object from the table, if it exists. The returned object has the same interface as above, with pk and version already set.</p>

<h5>Filter Method</h5>
<pre>
[object...] = Table.filter(db, ...)
</pre>
      <p>Returns a list of objects that matches the query. If no argument is given, returns all objects in the table. 
	  The query arguments use the following format: <em>columnname__op</em>=<em>value</em> where <em>columnname</em> is the column name of the object, 
	  <em>op</em> is the operator, and <em>value</em> is the right operand. For the equality operator, <em>__eq</em> is not needed. For example:</p>
      
<pre>
results = User.filter(db, age__gt=33)
...
results = User.filter(db, firstName="Joe")
results # [&lt;User: Joe Smith&gt;]
</pre>      
      
      <p>The supported operators are <tt>ne</tt> (not equal), <tt>gt</tt> (greater than), and <tt>lt</tt> (less than). Raise <tt>AttributeError</tt> if
	  either the field does not exist or the operator is not supported (e.g. <em>firstName__wut</em>).
	  When the field is a foreign key, you can use either the object itself or its id. For example:</p>

<pre>
results = Account.filter(db, user=joe)
# or
results = Account.filter(db, user=2)
</pre>  
       <p>You are only required to support at most one query argument, though you may try supporting multiple arguments by calculating the set intersection
	      between multiple query results.</p>
<h5>Count Method</h5>
<pre>
number = Table.count(db, ...)
</pre>  
      <p>Returns the number of matches given the query. If no argument is given, returns the number of rows in the table. 
	  The query format is the same as above. You can use this method to check if an object exists without fetching the entire object.</p>
<pre>
if Table.count(db, id=2) == 1:
    # id exists
else:
    # id does not exist
</pre>  
      <p>Note that the EasyDB internal column <tt>id</tt> only supports equality and inequality and no other operators. Same as the filter method, you are only responsible for 
	    at most one query argument.</p>
      <h4 id="custom_types">Custom Types</h4>
      
      <p>In this section, you will build custom field types that is not natively supported by the underlying database. Your ORM layer will seamlessly convert to and from the database's storage type, and perform type safety checks as is required.</p>
      
      <h5>Datetime Field</h5>
      <p>Create a new field, <tt>DateTime</tt>, which is represented in Python by a datetime.datetime instance. For example:</p>
      
<pre>

      <p>As a reminder, you must support calling a function if <tt>default</tt> is assigned a function. For the datetime instance, 
	  you can ignore time zone related settings. 
	  Hint: store it in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.timestamp">POSIX timestamp</a> format.
	  The base default value for the datetime field should be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">POSIX time</a>.</p>
      
      <h5>Coordinate Field</h5>
      <p>Create a new field, <tt>Coordinate</tt>, which is represented in Python by a 2-tuple, and must be a valid 
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system">geographic coordinate</a> in latitude and longitude. For example:</p>

<pre>      
class Capital(orm.Table):
    name = orm.String()
    location = orm.Coordinate()      

# main.py
ottawa = Capital.filter(db, name="Ottawa")[0]
ottawa.location   #(45.4215, 75.6972)      
</pre>
      <p>If the coordinate is invalid, you must raise <tt>ValueError</tt> when <em>the value is being set</em> (except if the value is not
	  2-tuple, in which case you raise a <tt>TypeError</tt>). For example:</p>
<pre>      
&gt;&gt;&gt; ottawa.location  = (-20, 999.99)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ValueError: invalid coordinate
</pre>

	  <p>For the <em>filter</em> method on this field, you shall apply the operator to both the latitude and longitude and return objects
	    that satisfy both conditions. e.g., if the value is (10, 20) and
	     the operator is <tt>GT</tt>,
  	     then return all Capital objects where latitude is greater than 10 and longitude is greater than 20.
		 You may assume that you will always read back a valid coordinate from the database.</p>
      
      <p>Hint: store it using two native EasyDB fields, and use the underscore character so that there is no conflict with user-defined column names. For example:</p>
<pre>
Capital {
    name : string;
    location_lat : float;
    location_lon : float;
}
</pre>
      <p>The base default value for the coordinate field should be <tt>(0, 0)</tt>.</p>
      <h4 id="testing">Testing Your Code</h4>
      <p>To test your database client, you will need to run the server. You can start the server by running <tt>easydb -g PORT</tt> on one terminal while running the client on a different terminal, where the <tt>-g</tt> option will print everything the database is doing, and <tt>PORT</tt> is the port number. You should choose a unique port number so that other people also working on your machine would not accidentally connect to your database. By default, the server will load <tt>default.txt</tt> for the database schema, but you will need to supply a different one if your ORM schema differs. Type <tt>easydb</tt> to see the usage on how to specify a different schema file.</p>
      
      <p>To test the database client or the ORM layer, you can either write a custom script that imports <tt>schema.py</tt>, or you can run in interactive mode using the <tt>main.py run</tt> command. It will start interactive mode with all the classes and functions defined in <tt>schema.py</tt> loaded, as well as automatically connecting to the database, and storing the database object as <tt>db</tt>. For example:</p>
      
<pre>
student:~/asst2$ ./main.py run
Python 3.5.2 (default, Oct  8 2019, 13:06:37) 
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux

&lt;EasyDB Database object&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; user = User(db, firstName="Greg", lastName="Russell", age=27)
&gt;&gt;&gt; user.save()
&gt;&gt;&gt; db.get("User", 1)
['Greg', 'Russell', 0.0, 27]
