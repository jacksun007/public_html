<h2>Introduction to Git</h2>

<h3>What is Git</h3>

<p>Git is a source code management system that allows a group
of programmers to work together on the same collection of source files without
getting in each others' way any more than necessary. It also keeps track of the
change history of the collection and makes it possible to examine the way things
looked at arbitrary times in the past. And finally, by keeping track of what is
and is not part of a project, it helps programmers maintain the organization of
large projects. If you have used CVS or SVN in the past, you will find that Git
is much more powerful than its predecessors. 

<h4>Why source management?</h4>

<p>In most of your course work, each assignment is a distinct unit: you sit down
and code something up, you hand it in, it gets graded, and you immediately
forget about it or even throw it away. In this environment, a source management
system is not really necessary and may, if imposed by course staff, seem like a
waste of time.</p>

<p>In the real world, however, programs are large and expensive to develop, and
so their life-cycles are measured in years or sometimes decades. Over these time
scales, and with such large amounts of code, just keeping track of everything
becomes a major problem.</p>

<p>Worse, in the real world, programs have users, who are not part of the
development team and not (generally) interested in internal details of the
program. Usually, someone insists that now and then a new version be made
available to the users. The development team has to be able to issue these
releases, and then also has to be able, for years afterwards, to handle bug
reports and sometimes issue fixes. In this environment it is imperative to be
able to go to some central place and get a copy of the precise release you
need.</p>

<p>And finally, when you have a number of programmers working on the same
program at once, it's essential that some mechanism be put in place to allow
them to coordinate their work. Otherwise, each programmer's version slowly
diverges from the others, and eventually everyone has a private version
different from everyone else's... and none of them work. Once this happens, it
takes an immense amount of effort to straighten out the mess.</p>

<p>Source management (or version control) systems are designed to help
programming teams handle these issues.</p>

<p>In this course, the probable lifetime of your project is a few months, not a
few years, and most likely no more than two people will be working on it at
once. Furthermore, the OS161 source you will be working with is several orders
of magnitude smaller than a large real-world project. Nonetheless, it is large
enough, the time is long enough, and there are enough people involved that
failure to use some kind of source management system would be an act of reckless
folly.</p>

<h4>Why Git?</h4>

<p>We require the use of Git because it is reasonably powerful, freely (and
widely) available, and commonly used. Many large open-source and proprietary
projects are managed using Git.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with another source management system (such as SVN),
Git should be easy to understand and use.</p>
