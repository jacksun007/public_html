        <h2>Assignment 4: Remote Procedure Call Framework</h2>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Due Date: December 18th, 11:59pm</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Lab TA: Mike Qin</strong></p>

<p>In this assignment, you will develop a type-safe remote procedure call framework (RPC) in C++.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>In a distributed environment, you often need to invoke a procedure on another machine. Consider a member function <code>int Foo::Hash(int x)</code>,
 if you want to invoke it locally, you can write <code>foo.Hash(x)</code> where <code>foo</code> is an object of class <code>Foo</code> and <code>x</code> is an integer.
 In order to perform a remote procedure call, you would like to write in the following way:</p>

<pre>auto result = client-&gt;Call(foo, &amp;Foo::Hash, x);
client-&gt;Flush();
result-&gt;data(); // This represents the return value
</pre>

<p><code>client</code> represents a RPC client, which it's initialized before this snippet. <code>Call()</code> does not call the function immediately,
 instead, it encodes the function call as a network request and sends it to the RPC server. The <code>Call()</code> function is non-blocking and returns a <code>result</code> object to represent the result of the remote procedure call. The result is not available until the client calls <code>client-&gt;Flush()</code> to flush the network buffer and waits for the server to respond. After this, the result can be accessed using <code>result-&gt;data()</code>.</p>

<h3 id="remote-methods">Remote Objects and Functions</h3>

<p>Function and object pointers in a remote procedure call belong to two different address spaces. For example, addresses of <code>&amp;foo</code> and <code>&amp;Foo::Hash</code> are totally different on the client and on the server. So we need to introduce universal object and function IDs. To make this framework easier to use, objects need to inherit our <code>Service&lt;T&gt;</code> template class, where <code>T</code> is user's class name. For example, <code>class MyService : public Service&lt;MyServie&gt; ...</code>.</p>

<p>On the client, users can call <code>set_instance_id()</code> on the service object. The instance id must be consistent with the RPC server. On the RPC server, users can call <code>AddService()</code> to export a service object.</p>

<pre><code>server-&gt;AddService(new MyService(), the_instance_id);
</code></pre>

<p><code>server</code> represents an RPC server and <code>the_instance_id</code> must be consistent with the id on the client side.</p>

<p>For a given service, function IDs must also be consistent between the server and the client. Notice that both the client and the server must call the service constructor, we can construct the mapping between member functions and their IDs in the constructor. We require users to call the <code>Export()</code> function for the member function they want to RPC. For example:</p>

<pre><code>MyService::MyService()
{
    Export(&amp;MyService::Hash);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Export()</code> function keeps an internal, per-object counter to generate function IDs automatically and stores the mapping between function pointers and IDs. We require the constructor to be deterministic, and so the function IDs are consistent between the client and the server.</p>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<pre><code>cd ~/ece326
tar -xf /cad2/ece326f/src/rpc.tar
git status # should say that "asst4/" directory is untracked
git add asst4
git commit -m "Initial code for Assignment 4"
git tag Asst4-start
git push
git push --tags
cd asst4/
</code></pre>

<p>We use googletest as a unittest framework in this assignment. Let's acquire that via a git submodule command (make sure you are inside the <code>asst4/</code> directory).</p>

<pre>
asst4% git submodule add https://github.com/google/googletest.git
</pre>

<p>For people whose partners have already checked in the starter code, do not run the above command. The submodule should have already been "added" internally. However, git requires
every local repository to initialize the submodule. So do this instead:</p>

<pre>
asst4% git pull
asst4% git submodule init
asst4% git submodule update
</pre>

<p>The starter code contain the following files:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Makefile</code> and <code>cc.mk</code>: The build system. Type <code>make</code> to build your project. Do not modify these files.</li>
<li><code>rpc.cc</code> and <code>rpc.h</code>: Implement network infrastructure and basic RPC calling convention. Do not modify these files.</li>
<li><code>test-rpc-common.h</code>: Common code for all unittests. Do not modify this file.</li>
<li><code>test-proto.cc</code>: Unittest for task 1, which tests your implementation on how a certain type is encoded/decoded correctly. Do not modify this file.</li>
<li><code>test-simple.cc</code> and <code>test-complex.cc</code>: Unittest for task 2, which tests your implementation of the type-safe RPC API. Do not modify these files.</li>
<li><code>rpcxx.h</code>: This is an example implementation for you to start. <em>You should modify this file only.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>To compile, simply type <code>make</code>, i.e.:

<pre>
cd ~/ece326/asst4
make
</pre>

<p>Note that <tt>test-proto.cc</tt> and <tt>test-complex.cc</tt> will not compile at the moment. By default all unittests are generated under the <code>Release/</code> directory. For debug build, you can <code>make BUILD=Debug</code>.</p>

<!--It does not implement the protocol of how to encode/decode a certain type, which is task 1 of this assignment. -->

<h3 id="solution-requirements">Solution Requirements</h3>

<p>We breakdown this lab into two tasks. Both of them must be implemented inside the <code>rpcxx.h</code> file. An example implementation is given.</p>

<p>With the example implementation, only <code>test-simple</code> compiles. Both tasks require your code to compile with all unittests. 
Upon a successful compilation, you can run test binaries under the output directory for test results, for example:</p>

<pre><code>Release/test-simple
</code></pre>

<h4 id="task-1">Task 1: Protocol for Parameter and Result Types</h4>

<p>The RPC library needs to encode/decode function parameters and function return values from the network. Currently, this implementation is missing. 
Your first task is to specialize the template class <code>Protocol</code> to implement this.</p>

<p>We need to support the following types: <code>int</code>, <code>bool</code>, <code>char</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>long</code>, 
<code>long long</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, 
and <code>std::string</code>. You also need to support all the unsigned integer types (e.g., <code>unsigned int</code>, <code>unsigned char</code>, etc).
</p>

<p>The example code provides the <code>Protocol&lt;T&gt;</code> definition. You need to specialize the <code>Protocol</code> class for each supported type. 
Each specialization must support two static member functions: <code>Encode()</code> and <code>Decode()</code>. 
Both must check if the input/output buffer has enough allocated size for encoding or decoding. 
The example code contain a samples implementation for <code>int</code>. The <code>test-basic</code> and <code>test-proto</code> 
unittests contain all test cases you need to pass for this task. The starter code in <code>rpcxx.h</code> should pass for 
<code>BasicTest.IntTest</code>.</p>

<p>It is up to you to decide how to implement the RPC protocol. However, to simplify the assignment,
we <b>do not</b> require or suggest that you convert multi-byte native data types to network byte (big-endian) order,
even though it is good engineering practice to do so. Note that we will not test your code on different architectures.</p>

<p>Here are some hints to help you get started:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can use the <code>sizeof</code> operator to return the number of bytes used by a type. 
The <code>sizeof</code> operator returns a <em>compile-time constant</em>. As such, you may be able to use it to write
templates that will implement encoding and decoding of all the supported data types <em>except for</em> <code>std::string</code>.</li>
<li><code>std::string</code> is a variable-sized data type. Therefore, your <code>Encode</code> function needs to somehow let 
the <code>Decode</code> function know the length of the string. The two most common solutions are 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null-terminated_string">null-terminated strings</a> (C strings)
and length-prefixed strings (Pascal strings). Note that EasyDB access protocol from assignment 1 and 3 uses Pascal strings because
null-terminated strings do not support byte arrays, which may contain null characters. The tester will not check if your solution
supports byte arrays.
You are strongly encourage to read through the <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/">reference manual</a> for 
<code>std::string</code>. 
Pay attention the the <code>front</code> and <code>assign</code> member functions and the different constructors.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="task-2">Task 2: Type-Safe RPC API</h4>

<p>In this task, you will implement APIs needed for type-safe RPC. The basic RPC layer is given to you with several functions missing. Your task is to implement these missing parts.</p>

<p>On the server side, the <code>Server</code> class is complete. The missing part is the <code>Service&lt;Svc&gt;::Export()</code> function. This function should take any member function of the class <code>Svc</code>, and register the member function as a possible RPC by calling <code>ExportRaw()</code>. The first parameter of <code>ExportRaw()</code> is the member function pointer, which need to be casted into <code>void *</code> type. The second parameter of <code>ExportRaw()</code> is a <code>BaseProcedure</code> object, which describes how to decode this member function from the network depending on its type. This is done by overriding the <code>DecodeAndExecute()</code> virtual function in a subclass.</p>

<p>Currently, an incomplete solution is given to you. This solution only works for member functions that takes one integer and returns an integer. Thus the inherited <code>BaseProcedure</code> class is called <code>IntIntProcedure&lt;Svc&gt;</code>. For this specific type of member functions, <code>IntIntProcedure&lt;Svc&gt;::DecodeAndExecute()</code> decodes one integer from the input stream, converts the <code>void * func_ptr</code> to its original member function type and executes it. Finally, based on its return value type, it encodes one integer to the output stream.</p>

<p>Notice that the <code>DecodeAndExecute()</code> has similar semantic with <code>Protocol&lt;T&gt;::Decode()</code>. This function returns false if the buffer <code>in_len</code> isn't large enough or any fatal error happens during parsing.</p>

<p>On the client side, the networking part is complete. You need to implement the <code>Client::Call()</code> function, 
which converts the member function and its parameters into network data and then sends them over the network. 
This function takes many parameters. The first parameter is the service pointer, the second is the member function you want to RPC. 
After these, depending on the type of the member function, <em>this function takes all parameters you need to pass into the member function</em>. 
The return type also depends on the type of the member function. 
It needs to inherit the <code>BaseResult</code> class and its <code>data()</code> function should return the result of the corresponding type 
on the client-side when ready.</p>

<p>The <code>BaseClient::Send()</code> function can help you implement this task. This function takes an instance ID, a function ID, a <code>BaseParams</code> that describes how to encode function parameters and a <code>BaseResult</code> that describes how to decode result. <code>BaseParams::Encode()</code> virtual function describes how to encode parameters into the network buffer and <code>BaseResult::HandleResponse()</code> describes how to decode result from the network buffer.</p>

<p>In the incomplete implementation that's given to you, since it only supports member functions that takes one integer and returns an 
integer, both the <code>IntResult</code> (<code>BaseResult</code>) and <code>IntParam</code> (<code>BaseParams</code>) only support one 
integer. Please refer to the starter code, <code>rpcxx.h</code>, for further details.</p>

<p>There are three unit-tests for this task. First, <code>test-simple</code> should compile and pass for the starter code that's given to you. 
You should use this as a regression test. Second, you need to pass <code>test-complex</code>, which is a more complicated test. 
Lastly, <code>test-exhaustive</code> will create random member functions and a random number of parameters and types.
The sample solution <strong>cannot</strong> compile with <code>test-complex</code> or <code>test-exhaustive</code> yet.</p>

<p>You are suggested to first try to replicate the starter code for task 2 to gain a deeper understanding of the client/server communication.
You are suggested to read through <a href="https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/pointers-to-members">this wiki page</a> if you are not familiar with
how member function pointers work. <code>test-complex</code> requires you to support the following types of member functions:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>void (Svc::*)()</code>: Required for <code>InitializeSomeRandomThing</code>, a function whose return type is <code>void</code> (i.e., nothing) and takes no parameters.</li>
  <li><code>bool (Svc::*)()</code>: Required for <code>CheckInitialized</code>, a function whose return type is <code>bool</code> and takes no parameters.</li>
  <li><code>std::string (Svc::*)(unsigned int)</code>: Required for <code>Guess</code>, a function whose return type is <code>std::string</code> and takes one parameter of type 
  <code>unsigned int</code>.</li>
  <li><code>std::string (Svc::*)(std::string, int)</code>: Required for <code>Repeat</code>, a function whose return type is <code>std::string</code> and takes <em>two</em> parameters 
	of types <code>std::string</code> and <code>int</code>.</li>
  <li><code>unsigned long(Svc::*)(int, unsigned int)</code>: Required for <code>TestSign</code>, a function whose return type is <code>unsigned long</code> and takes two parameters 
	of types <code>int</code> and <code>unsigned int</code>.</li>
  <li><code>void (Svc::*)(std::string, std::string)</code>: Required for <code>Put</code>, a function whose return type is <code>void</code> and takes two parameters 
	of type <code>std::string</code>.</li> 	
  <li><code>std::string (Svc::*)(std::string)</code>: Required for <code>Get</code>, a function whose return type is <code>std::string</code> and takes one parameter
	of type <code>std::string</code>.</li> 
</ol>

<p>You should be able to get (1) working easily because no parameters or return value are exchanged between the client and the server. 
(2-3, 7) should be similarly easy because you can follow the example in sample code on how to send a single argument to the server and then
transmit the return value back to the client. For (4-6) you will need to understand how to chain calls to <code>Protocol::Encode</code> and 
<code>Protocol::Decode</code>. This involves keeping track of the buffer's <em>current position</em> and <em>remaining length</em>, similar
to what you have done in assignment 1, but this time in C++.</p>

<p>You are highly suggested to work from top to bottom because that's the order in which the tester runs. If the tester crashes on the
first test case, it won't get to the subsequent test cases, even if they are working.</p>

<p>While working on passing <code>test-complex</code> you should think deeply about how to generalize the code so that you can
support any number of parameters of any types. You will need to use many variadic templates to do this. However, make sure you are able to
fully pass <code>test-complex</code> before trying to take on <code>test-exhaustive</code>.</p>
